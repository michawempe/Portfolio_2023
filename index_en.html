            I had the opportunity to create a large red carpet installation in front of the Alte Oper in Frankfurt for AAAREA. The project was created while working at Nordisk Büro and aimed to
            promote the new event platform AAAREA. AAAREA ran during Fashion Week in Frankfurt and presented many interdisciplinary and collaborative formats to showcase the latest trends in fashion.
            <br />

            The installation was placed on the red carpet of the brand gala and caught the attention of the guests. With an impressive design and eye-catching details, the installation became a focal
            point. <br />

            This project allowed me to deepen my skills in event design and brand marketing.

            There are many programs that want to simplify the design of various media for people who are not familiar with the subject. In most cases, however, the users still have to make many
            important important design decisions. I want to change that with this project. It deals with translating the conventional design process into a digital process. It a digital tool has been
            created for designing advertising media. Central to the program is "ViSyn", a gender-neutral agent that guides users through the digital design process. design process. During
            implementation, the use of AI models is inevitable, because new AI models are regularly created that make it even easier to design with an AI. The debate about what impact AI has and will
            have on design is becoming more intense. In line with this, I have elaborated on the advantages that such AI models can have vs. human-to-human interaction.

            I had the pleasure to work with Nordisk office on the design for Matrix42's "Digital Workspace World 2022" conference. Here, my focus was on creating the key visuals that would visualize
            the message of the conference. The conference offers attendees a platform for exchange with experts and provides answers and strategies to the most important questions of the digital
            future of work. <br />
            For the implementation of the visual, the given shape was translated into a three-dimensional representation, which was brought into different formats. A visual concept was developed that
            gets to the heart of the conference's message. The key visual is a central component of the marketing campaign and is used in various digital and printed formats.

            As part of a course, I developed the "Think inside the new Box" concept for ConCon. As a technology-oriented event, ConCon always wants to keep pace with new developments. In my project, I
            focused on the changes that can result from the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). My idea was to visualize an AI Box that houses different AI visuals. The animation of the elements
            symbolizes the transition from a graphic space to a space with AI elements. In the AI Booth, visitors can experience this for themselves by giving various instructions, such as a
            naturalistic representation of technology, causing the space to change accordingly. Several projections are installed on the stage, and their appearance gradually changes as the elements
            become more and more abstracted. The design of the stage can be customized by each speaker. <br />
            Together with Paul Eßer and Prof. Florian Jenett, I presented the concepts in a Booth at ConCon 2022. The booth we planned and designed showed how AI can change the appearance of ConCon in
            the future.

            The posters were created in a course in which a campaign was to be created on a topic close to my heart. My focus here was on the image change of adopting street dogs. <br />
            When designing the posters, I was inspired by the texts of advertising posters of various dating agencies, since the dogs are also about dating. My goal was to make the message appealing
            to motivate further information gathering. <br />
            To create the posters, 3D scanned porcelain dogs were used as models. Hair was added to these in 3D software. The clear design is intended to take the pure emotionality out of the topic
            and thus convey a more positive image.

            On behalf of the organization "misch mit!" I was allowed to design a project that advocates for people with refugee experience. The idea behind the project was to address and correct
            prejudices against these people. <br />
            I designed coasters on which prejudices are depicted and set right in a clear, direct statement. The goal was to juxtapose the two parties, the people with many and few prejudices against
            people with refugee experience, and to stimulate a discussion. <br />
            Through clear, direct language and eye-catching design, the coasters are intended to help promote understanding of people with refugee experience.
